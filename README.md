# YouTube Ad-Free Viewer

## Overview

YouTube Ad-Free Viewer is a web application designed to provide an ad-free YouTube video viewing experience. The project was initiated in response to YouTube's increasingly aggressive measures to counter ad-blockers, resulting in instances where users still encounter ads despite having ad-blockers installed. By utilizing this tool and viewing videos through an iframe, users can avoid ads completely.

## How to Use

1. Some YouTube embeds may not function correctly in local development environments due to YouTube's security measures and the restrictions imposed by web browsers regarding cross-origin requests. To address these issues and ensure that YouTube embeds work as intended, it's advisable to host your web page on a server or use an online development environment

2. Once the code is running , enter the unique YouTube video ID (e.g., XfqOB4hvxlY) into the designated input field.
3. Click the "Submit" button.
4. The video will be displayed through an iframe, ensuring an ad-free experience.

## Disclaimer

- The YouTube Ad-Free Viewer project does not encourage bypassing YouTube's monetization model or infringing upon the rights of content creators.
- Users are encouraged to support their favorite content creators by watching videos on the official YouTube platform, which may include advertisements.
